2
00:00:15,351 --> 00:01:03,881
00:00:15,351 they become goblins.

2
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:05,881
00:01:03,951they become goblins.

3
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:17,081
00:01:12,981A blade smeared with blood from countless battles...

4
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:21,421
00:01:17,951was enchanted with a powerful desire bedewed with its master's blood.

5
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:42,951
00:01:38,121Only the bride of the goblin will be able to draw the blade.

6
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:48,421
00:01:44,051Once drawn, everything will turn to ashes, and peace will be granted.

7
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,781
00:01:58,351Some malicious oracle it was.

8
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,481
00:02:03,481When goblins are brought back,

9
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,621
00:02:07,081they come to this world and can be found everywhere, but nowhere.

10
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,251
00:02:10,721Even now, they can be...

11
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:17,421
00:02:15,221What are you laughing about?

12
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:21,451
00:02:18,581"The goblin is looking for its bride..."

13
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,251
00:02:21,581 "which happens to be me." Is that it?

14
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,521
00:02:26,021I may not look like it, but I was a man-eater in my days.

15
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,381
00:02:30,021 I might not be here the next time you come around.

16
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,251
00:02:33,721I envy you.

17
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,281
00:02:36,821 I must be going senile.

18
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,881
00:02:38,551 I shouldn't say that in front of a single mother.

19
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,521
00:02:43,281 You're mean.

20
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,381
Mean? How much of a discount did I give you on my vegetables?

21
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,751
00:02:49,121The man who left you is the mean one.

22
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:55,521
00:02:54,081 That's true.

23
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,081
00:02:57,221 That's a sad story, by the way.

24
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:01,381
00:02:59,751 What's there to be sad about?

25
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,921
00:03:01,381 It's a romantic, yet tragic curse.

26
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:06,621
00:03:04,221 Having to look for a bride just to be killed.

27
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,081
00:03:08,621 The creator is evil.

28
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,421
00:03:10,121 It's always been that way.

29
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,121
00:03:12,551 It's selfish and envious.

30
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,321
00:03:15,791It's very self-centered.

31
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:22,081
That sounds just like someone I know.

32
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,251
00:03:23,951 I should go now. Thanks for the story.

33
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,821
00:03:26,421 -Make sure to be here the next time I come.

34
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,721
00:03:35,121At a moment of life and death,

35
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:40,751
00:03:38,181 make a wish with a powerful desire.

36
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:46,851
00:03:42,181 A soft-hearted creator might grant you that wish.

37
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:06,581
00:04:04,921I wouldn't do that if I were you.

38
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:09,751
00:04:06,921If you run away from home now, you'll be even more miserable.

39
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,451
00:04:10,121 -- You'll never see your mom again. - Who are you?

40
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,951
00:04:12,851 -->- Are you Korean? - It's more complicated than that.

41
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,581
00:04:15,281 It's your turn now.

42
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:18,881
00:04:17,281 Tell him with a loud and clear voice.

43
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:24,481
00:04:20,621"You adopted me so that makes me your son. Take good care of me."

44
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,151
00:04:24,751 Ask your mom for help.

45
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,151
00:04:27,381 - Tell her it hurts. - What are you talking about?

46
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,251
00:04:29,481 - Get out of my way. - A light wound...

47
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,581
00:04:31,251 like that won't ever kill you.

48
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,381
00:04:34,751 - Who are you? - Look them in the eyes and say it.

49
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,821
00:04:37,651 Can you do that?

50
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,051
00:04:38,951 And if he beats me to death? Will you take responsibility?

51
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,921
00:04:42,151 That's why I broke his ribs for you.

52
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:45,621
00:04:43,921 You little brat.

53
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,981
00:04:53,781 This is your lunch. Go to school after you talk to them.

54
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,281
00:04:55,981 The answer for question 17 on the Math test is 4, not 2.

55
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,481
00:04:58,281 That's the only one you get wrong.

56
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,451
00:04:59,721 Who on earth are you?

57
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,121
00:05:18,121 He is...

58
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,821
00:05:19,821 the water, the fire, the wind,

59
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,321
00:05:22,821 the light, and the dark.

60
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:27,251
00:05:26,121 And he was once...

61
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:35,781
00:05:34,681 a human.

62
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,051
00:06:02,751People considered him...

63
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:06,851
00:06:05,551 divine.

64
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,181
00:06:12,221 He was covered in red blood...

65
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,081
00:06:14,481 as he attacked the enemy.

66
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,581
00:06:20,421 He was a divine warrior.

66
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:42,581
00:06:23,421 He was a divine warrior.

66
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:59,581
00:06:44,421 He was a divine warrior.

66
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:59,581
00:07:01,421 He was a divine warrior.

66
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:29,581
00:08:00,421 He was a divine warrior.

67
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:38,651
00:08:31,521 - Salute General! - Salute General!

68
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,551
It's the victorious General!

69
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:44,551
00:08:41,681 - Salute General! - Salute General!

69
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:52,551
00:08:47,681 - Salute General! - Salute General!

70
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,781
00:08:56,081 Open the gates!

71
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:01,121
00:08:57,921 Here comes the victorious General!

72
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,181
00:09:01,721 Kim Shin, take off your gears and receive the royal command.

73
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,321
00:09:07,321 How dare you?

74
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,581
00:09:09,151 Try saying that again.

75
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,691
00:09:10,581 How dare such a lowly soldier like you call General's name?

76
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,651
00:09:13,691 Kim Shin, the rebel leader.

77
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:18,121
00:09:16,191 - Take off your gears... - How dare you?

78
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,781
00:09:20,251 I heard you the first time. Wait.

79
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:37,581
00:09:36,551 -Is that good?

80
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,851
00:09:38,381 You have committed high treason. Bite your sword, kneel down,

81
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:42,851
00:09:41,851 and receive the royal command.

82
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,651
00:09:42,851 I shall cut off your tongue!

83
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,521
00:09:44,651 How could he commit high treason? Are you insane?

84
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:48,921
00:09:47,751 Are you crazy?

85
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,551
00:09:58,551 General.

86
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,051
00:09:59,551 You have committed high treason. Bite your sword, kneel down...

87
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,921
00:10:07,081 I will meet His Majesty. Step aside.

88
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:12,821
00:10:09,951 - Kim Shin, you... - If you try to stop me, you'll die.

89
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:34,691
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:34,691 Step aside.

90
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,021
How dare you?
